    <p>An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp.). Fruit trees of the orchard or domestic apple (Malus domestica), the most widely grown in the genus, are cultivated worldwide. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia before they were introduced to North America by European colonists.</p>

    <p>According to a recent scientific study published in Nature Genetics, the precursors to oranges and citrus plants originated more than 25 million years ago on the Indian subcontinent. The research team discovered that these fruits originated at the same time that the Indian subcontinent was colliding with continental Asia and creating the Himalayas.</p>

<p>In Europe, until the 17th century cultivated plants were obtained by transplanting strawberries from the forests; the plants were propagated asexually by pegging down the runners, allowing them to root, and then separating the new plants</p>
